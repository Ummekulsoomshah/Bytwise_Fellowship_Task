### `Bytwise Fellowship`

### Internship Learning - Week 1

#### Task 1: Set Up the React App
- **Best Practices Used by Developers:**
  - **Using YARN**
    - **Why Yarn?**
      - **Enhanced Performance:** Faster dependency installation.
      - **Extra Security:** Ensures integrity and security of packages.
      - **Offline Availability:** Ability to install packages without an internet connection.

#### Task 2: Brush Up HTML, CSS, JavaScript Concepts
- **Status:** Done
- **Application:** Working on an eCommerce website named TechStock using these technologies.

#### Task 3: Familiarity with JSX Syntax
- **What is JSX?**
  - JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
  - It is HTML written within JavaScript, but it is neither pure HTML nor pure JavaScript.
- **Why JSX?**
  - It simplifies the process of making UIs in React by allowing developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript.

#### Task 4: Learn Components
- **Understanding Components:**
  - Components are the essence of React.js.
  - React.js is a Component-Based Architecture framework, utilizing components that are:
    - **Composable:** Can be combined to create complex UIs.
    - **Readable:** Easy to understand and follow.
    - **Reusable:** Can be reused across different parts of the application.
    - **Replaceable:** Can be swapped out without affecting the entire system.
    - **Modular:** Encapsulates functionality within isolated units.
    - **Easily Testable:** Can be tested independently.

- **Benefits:**
  - These characteristics make React.js popular and efficient for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

#### Final Project for the Week:
- **Project:** Music Website
- **Application of Concepts:**
  1. **Created React App:**
     - Used Yarn instead of npm and Vite for project setup.
  2. **Component Design:**
     - Developed components that are self-distinguishable, easy to read, understand, debug, and test.
